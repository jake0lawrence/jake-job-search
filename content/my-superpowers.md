## The Core Four

These are my main strengths. If a job needs these, I'm a fit.

### 1. 🎯 Making Customers Successful

- 13/14 executive escalations resolved successfully

**Industry terms:** Customer Success, Account Management, Retention

**Evidence:**
- 100+ implementations delivered
- 92% on-time, 95% on-budget
- Full lifecycle from kickoff to hypercare

**Industry terms:** Implementation, Professional Services, Solutions Delivery

### 3. 📚 Training & Enablement

- 120+ training sessions delivered
- 650+ people trained
- 4.8/5 satisfaction rating
- Built programs that scale (webinars, playbooks, self-serve resources)

## The Differentiators

These set me apart from other candidates.

### 🏛️ Government Expertise

I have a Master's in Public Administration and worked *inside* government for 5 years before becoming a consultant. I understand government operations, procurement, and stakeholders in a way most people don't.

**Proof:** MPA degree, Court Clerk experience, 100+ government implementations

### 🔀 Both Sides of the Table

I've been the customer AND the consultant. I implemented software for my own organization, then joined the vendor and implemented it for 100+ others. This gives me empathy and insight that's rare.

### 📈 I Build Systems

I don't just do the work—I create processes, playbooks, and tools that scale. My playbooks were adopted across 87% of my portfolio. I make things repeatable.

### 🧯 Crisis Management

When things go wrong, I stay calm and fix them. 13 of 14 executive escalations resolved without giving away the farm. I protect relationships AND the business.

## The Soft Stuff

The interpersonal skills that make everything else work:

---

## What I'm NOT

Being honest about gaps:

- **Not a developer** — I can't write production code
- **Not a salesperson** — I don't do cold calling or quota-driven sales
- **Not a designer** — I make functional things, not beautiful things
- **Not a manager (yet)** — I've led projects, not teams
