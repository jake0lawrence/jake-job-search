## The Core Four

These are my main strengths. If a job needs these, I'm a fit.

### 1. 🎯 Making Customers Successful

**What it means:** After someone buys software, I make sure they actually get value from it. I check in, solve problems, build relationships, and ensure they renew.

**Evidence:**
- Managed portfolios of ~100 customers/year ([[Pooled Portfolio Model]])
- Built [[Customer Health Dashboard System|health dashboards]] to spot problems early
- 13/14 executive escalations resolved successfully ([[Executive Escalation Resolution Program]])

**Key skills:** [[Customer Health Monitoring]], [[Escalation Management]], [[Strategic Account Management]]

**Industry terms:** Customer Success, Account Management, Retention

---

### 2. 🚀 Implementing Software

**What it means:** When an organization buys new software, I set it up for them. Requirements, configuration, data migration, training, go-live—the whole journey.

**Evidence:**
- [[100+ Municipal Court Implementations|100+ implementations delivered]]
- 92% on-time, 95% on-budget
- Full lifecycle from kickoff to hypercare

**Key skills:** [[Implementation & Deployment]], [[Data Migration]], [[Change Management]]

**Industry terms:** Implementation, Professional Services, Solutions Delivery

---

### 3. 📚 Training & Enablement

**What it means:** Teaching people how to use software effectively. Not just "click here"—actually helping them change how they work.

**Evidence:**
- [[Training & Enablement Program|120+ training sessions delivered]]
- 650+ people trained
- 4.8/5 satisfaction rating
- Built [[First 30 Days Adoption Program|programs that scale]] (webinars, playbooks, self-serve resources)

**Key skills:** [[Training & Enablement]], [[Product Adoption]], [[Onboarding]]

**Industry terms:** Enablement, Customer Education, Adoption

---

### 4. 📊 Data & Dashboards

**What it means:** Turning raw data into useful insights. Building dashboards, tracking metrics, making decisions based on evidence.

**Evidence:**
- Microsoft [[Power BI]] certified
- Built [[Customer Health Dashboard System|customer health dashboards]] from scratch
- Use data to prioritize and spot risks

**Key skills:** [[Power BI]], [[Customer Health Monitoring]]

**Industry terms:** Analytics, Business Intelligence, Power BI

## The Differentiators

These set me apart from other candidates.

### 🏛️ Government Expertise

I have a Master's in Public Administration and worked *inside* government for 5 years before becoming a consultant. I understand government operations, procurement, and stakeholders in a way most people don't.

**Proof:** MPA degree, [[Court Clerk - Administrative Hearings|Court Clerk experience]], [[100+ Municipal Court Implementations|100+ government implementations]]

**Key skill:** [[Public Sector & GovTech]]

### 🔀 Both Sides of the Table

I've been the customer AND the consultant. I implemented software for my own organization ([[Morton Grove Technology Modernization]]), then joined the vendor and implemented it for 100+ others. This gives me empathy and insight that's rare.

**Proof:** [[Tyler Municipal Justice Client-Side PM|Client-side PM]] → Vendor consultant

### 📈 I Build Systems

I don't just do the work—I create processes, playbooks, and tools that scale. My [[Customer Success Playbook System|playbooks]] were adopted across 87% of my portfolio. I make things repeatable.

**Key skill:** [[Playbook Development]]

### 🧯 Crisis Management

When things go wrong, I stay calm and fix them. [[Executive Escalation Resolution Program|13 of 14 executive escalations]] resolved without giving away the farm. I protect relationships AND the business.

**Key skill:** [[Escalation Management]]

---

## What I'm NOT

Being honest about gaps:

- **Not a developer** — I can't write production code
- **Not a salesperson** — I don't do cold calling or quota-driven sales
- **Not a designer** — I make functional things, not beautiful things
- **Not a manager (yet)** — I've led projects, not teams
