# API & Integrations

## Description

Configuring and troubleshooting integrations between software systems—including APIs, SFTP transfers, scheduled data feeds, and third-party system connections. Involves understanding data flows, mapping requirements, coordinating with technical teams, and resolving integration issues.

## Proficiency Breakdown

| Dimension             | Level      | Notes                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Theoretical knowledge | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆  | API concepts, data flows                |
| Practical application | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆  | Configured integrations on 50+ projects |
| Teaching ability      | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆   | Can explain to non-technical audiences  |
| Industry currency     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Essential for enterprise software       |

**Self-assessment:** Advanced. Configured integrations across 50+ implementations including API, SFTP, e-ticketing vendors, probation systems, and RMS. Not a developer, but can troubleshoot, coordinate with technical teams, and explain integration concepts to customers.

## Evidence & Proof Points

### Specific Accomplishments

- Configured integrations with third-party systems via API, SFTP, and scheduled data feeds
- Partnered with technical teams on data migration and validation
- Led integration activities including data conversion, offense code mapping, and interface configuration
- Troubleshot and resolved complex technical challenges (RMS ingest, GL mapping, SSO/SAML)
- Designed integrations with e-ticketing vendors (Brazos/Enforcement Mobile), probation systems

### Quantifiable Results

| Metric                | Value      | Context               |
| --------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Interface reject rate | <0.4%      | After tuning          |
| Conversion defects    | ≤0.7/1,000 | Migrated records      |
| Integration projects  | 50+        | API, SFTP, data feeds |

### Integration Types Worked With

- REST APIs
- SFTP file transfers
- Scheduled data feeds
- E-ticketing (Brazos, Enforcement Mobile)
- Probation/supervision systems
- RMS (Records Management Systems)
- GL/financial systems

## Interview Notes

**Common questions about this skill:**

1. "Describe a complex integration you configured."
2. "How do you troubleshoot integration failures?"
3. "How do you explain technical integration concepts to non-technical stakeholders?"

**Your STAR story:**

- **Situation:** RMS ingest integration failing with duplicate and rejected records threatening go-live timeline
- **Task:** Diagnose issue and implement fix while protecting project timeline
- **Action:** Coordinated with vendor and internal API dev; added retries, alerting, and payload normalization; validated fix in test environment
- **Result:** Duplicate/failed records reduced ~95%; timeline protected; account became reference
