# Implementation & Deployment

## Description

Leading end-to-end software implementations from requirements gathering through go-live and post-launch stabilization. Includes discovery, solution design, configuration, data migration, testing, training, cutover planning, and hypercare support.

## Proficiency Breakdown

| Dimension | Level | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Theoretical knowledge | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Implementation methodology |
| Practical application | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 100+ implementations |
| Teaching ability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Mentored consultants |
| Industry currency | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Core professional services skill |

**Self-assessment:** Expert. Led 100+ implementations for public sector and enterprise customers with 92% on-time and 95% on-budget delivery.

## Evidence & Proof Points

### Specific Accomplishments
- Led 100+ successful implementations for municipal and enterprise clients
- Maintained 92% on-time and 95% on-budget delivery over 24 months
- Managed 12-20 concurrent implementations while maintaining quality
- Created implementation playbooks (Cutover, Training, Integration) adopted across 87% of projects
- Reduced post-go-live conversion defects to ≤0.7 per 1,000 migrated records

### Quantifiable Results
| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Implementations led | 100+ | Municipal and enterprise |
| On-time delivery | 92% | Over 24 months |
| On-budget delivery | 95% | Over 24 months |
| Concurrent projects | 12-20 | Managed simultaneously |
