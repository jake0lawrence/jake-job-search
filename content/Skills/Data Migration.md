# Data Migration

## Description

Moving data from legacy systems to new platforms as part of software implementations. Involves discovery, mapping, extraction, transformation, validation, and reconciliation—ensuring data integrity and business continuity during system transitions.

## Proficiency Breakdown

| Dimension | Level | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Theoretical knowledge | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Migration methodology |
| Practical application | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 100+ migrations |
| Teaching ability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Created intake playbooks |
| Industry currency | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Essential implementation skill |

**Self-assessment:** Advanced. Led data migration activities across 100+ implementations with post-go-live defect rate of ≤0.7 per 1,000 migrated records. Created conversion intake playbooks that improved data sign-off time by 37%.

## Evidence & Proof Points

### Specific Accomplishments
- Led data conversion activities across 100+ implementations
- Created Conversion Intake playbook with standard checklist improving sign-off time 24→15 days (37%)
- Achieved post-go-live conversion defects ≤0.7 per 1,000 migrated records
- Coordinated offense code mapping across legacy systems, municipal codes, and state vehicle codes
- Partnered with technical teams on data validation and reconciliation

### Quantifiable Results
| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Sign-off improvement | 37% | 24→15 business days |
| Defect rate | ≤0.7/1,000 | Post-go-live |
| Migrations led | 100+ | Across implementations |
