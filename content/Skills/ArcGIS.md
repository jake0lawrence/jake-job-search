# ArcGIS

## Description

Esri's geographic information system (GIS) platform for mapping, spatial analysis, and location-based workflows. Used to create maps, publish GIS layers, build mobile field applications, and embed location-aware functionality into operational systems.

## Proficiency Breakdown

| Dimension             | Level      | Notes                              |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Theoretical knowledge | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆  | GIS concepts and applications      |
| Practical application | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆   | Implementation and configuration   |
| Teaching ability      | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆   | Trained field staff on mobile apps |
| Industry currency     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Standard GIS platform              |

**Self-assessment:** Intermediate. Hands-on experience deploying ArcGIS solutions for local government—including Collector/Field Maps for mobile inspections and publishing layers for asset management workflows. Not a GIS analyst, but understand how to leverage GIS in operational systems.

## Evidence & Proof Points

### Specific Accomplishments

- Deployed ArcGIS Collector/Field Maps for mobile inspections in Community Development
- Partnered with GIS to publish ArcGIS layers (assets, service lines, work zones)
- Embedded maps into EAM workflows for location-aware dispatch
- Improved field data quality and turnaround through mobile GIS tools
- Integrated GIS layers with enterprise asset management systems

### Quantifiable Results
