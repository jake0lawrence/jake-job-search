# EAM & Asset Management

## Description

Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) systems for tracking physical assets, managing work orders, scheduling preventive maintenance, and optimizing asset lifecycle. Used primarily in public works, utilities, facilities, and infrastructure-heavy organizations.

## Proficiency Breakdown

| Dimension             | Level      | Notes                           |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Theoretical knowledge | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆  | EAM concepts and best practices |
| Practical application | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Multiple EAM implementations    |
| Teaching ability      | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆  | Trained field and office staff  |
| Industry currency     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆  | Stable infrastructure market    |

**Self-assessment:** Advanced. Co-led EAM implementations for Public Works departments using CentralSquare and SAP. Configured asset/work-order models, established PM schedules, integrated with GIS, and trained field and office staff.

## Evidence & Proof Points

### Specific Accomplishments

- Co-led CentralSquare EAM rollout for Public Works (Morton Grove)
- Supported SAP EAM rollout for Public Works (Itasca)
- Configured asset/work-order models and established PM schedules
- Integrated EAM with GIS layers for location-aware dispatch
- Reduced work-order backlog ~20% and increased PM compliance to ~85%
- Coordinated with IT/Finance on chart of accounts mapping and cost capture

### Quantifiable Results

| Metric                       | Value       | Context                |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Work-order backlog reduction | ~20%        | Within two quarters    |
| PM compliance                | ~85%        | Up from lower baseline |
| Inspection-to-closeout       | ~35% faster | SAP EAM (Itasca)       |
| Staff trained                | 40+         | Field and office       |

### EAM Systems Experience

- EAM vendor positions (CentralSquare, SAP, IBM Maximo, etc.)

**Positioning:** Frame as implementation expertise with EAM domain knowledge—understanding both the technology and the operational workflows it supports. Valuable for roles bridging IT and operations.

## Interview Notes

**Common questions about this skill:**

1. "Describe your EAM implementation experience."
2. "How do you approach asset hierarchy design?"
3. "How did you drive adoption among field staff?"

**Your STAR story:**

- **Situation:** Public Works department with paper-based work orders, no preventive maintenance tracking, and growing backlog
- **Task:** Implement EAM system to modernize asset and work order management
- **Action:** Configured asset hierarchy, designed work order workflows, established PM schedules, integrated with GIS, trained 40+ field and office staff
- **Result:** Work-order backlog reduced ~20%; PM compliance increased to ~85%; field crews adopted mobile workflow
