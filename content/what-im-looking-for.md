# What I'm Looking For

Here's what I'm targeting, explained so you don't need to know tech industry jargon.

---

## The Roles (In Plain English)

### 1. Customer Success Manager (CSM)
**What it is:** After a company buys software, the CSM makes sure they actually succeed with it. You're their main point of contact, you check in regularly, you help them solve problems, and you make sure they renew their contract.

**Why I'm good at it:** I've been doing this for 5+ years. I've managed portfolios of 100+ customers, built health dashboards to spot problems early, and resolved executive escalations without losing customers.

**Salary range:** $90-140K

**Look for titles like:**
- Customer Success Manager
- Client Success Manager
- Customer Experience Manager
- Account Manager (when it's not sales-focused)

---

### 2. Implementation Consultant
**What it is:** When a company buys new software, someone needs to set it up. That's this role. You work with the customer to understand their needs, configure the software, migrate their data, train their team, and get them live.

**Why I'm good at it:** I've done 100+ implementations. 92% on-time, 95% on-budget. This is my wheelhouse.

**Salary range:** $90-130K

**Look for titles like:**
- Implementation Consultant
- Implementation Specialist
- Solutions Consultant
- Professional Services Consultant
- Onboarding Specialist

---

### 3. Enablement / Training Manager
**What it is:** Designing and delivering training programs that help customers use software effectively. This could be webinars, documentation, certification programs, or in-person training.

**Why I'm good at it:** I've delivered 120+ training sessions to 650+ people with a 4.8/5 satisfaction rating. I build programs that scale.

**Salary range:** $95-150K

**Look for titles like:**
- Customer Enablement Manager
- Customer Education Manager
- Training Manager
- Adoption Program Manager
- Customer Programs Manager

---

## The Industries

### My Sweet Spot: GovTech
**What it is:** Software companies that sell to government agencies (cities, counties, courts, state agencies).

**Why:** I have an MPA (Master of Public Administration) and worked in local government before becoming a consultant. I've done 100+ government software implementations. This is rare—most people haven't been on both sides.

**Companies:** Tyler Technologies (where I work now), OpenGov, Granicus, PayIt, Accela

### Also Great: General B2B SaaS
**What it is:** Any company that sells software to businesses (not consumers).

**Why:** The skills transfer directly. Customer Success and Implementation work the same way whether you're selling to governments or corporations.

**Companies:** Salesforce, Microsoft, Airtable, Intercom, any company you've heard of that sells to businesses

## The Company Profile

**Ideal company:**
- **Size:** 100-5,000 employees (big enough to have structure, small enough to matter)
- **Stage:** Growth stage or established (not super early startup)
- **Product:** Software that requires implementation and ongoing support (not self-serve)
- **Culture:** Values customer outcomes, not just sales numbers

**I'm flexible on:**
- Industry (tech, fintech, healthcare, etc.)
- Remote vs. hybrid vs. office
- Exact title

**I'm firm on:**
- Must be a product company (not an agency/consultancy)
- Must have a real CS or Implementation function
- Must be base-salary-heavy (not commission-dependent)

---

## Geography

- **Ideal:** Chicago-based or fully remote
- **Acceptable:** Midwest (could do occasional travel), Hybrid in Chicago
- **Probably not:** Relocation required, heavy travel (50%+)

---

## Compensation

| Component | Target | Floor |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Base salary | $110-130K | $90K |
| Bonus/Variable | 10-20% | Flexible |
| Total comp | $120-150K | $100K |

I'm flexible if the opportunity is exceptional, but these are my benchmarks.

## The Bottom Line

If you see a job posting with words like **"Customer Success," "Implementation," "Onboarding," "Enablement," or "Solutions Consultant"** at a **software company**—send it to me. I'll tell you if it's a fit.

When in doubt, just ask. 📱 815-307-2708
