## Career Timeline

### Now: Tyler Technologies (2020-2025)
**Role:** Implementation Consultant / Customer Success

The core of my experience. I help government organizations implement and succeed with court management software.

**What I do:**
- Lead software implementations from kickoff to go-live
- Train court staff and administrators
- Build customer relationships and ensure adoption
- Resolve escalations when things go sideways
- Create scalable processes (playbooks, templates, dashboards)

### Before: Local Government (2015-2020)
**Roles:** Management Analyst (Morton Grove), Deputy Village Clerk (Itasca), Court Clerk

I worked *inside* government before I started serving government as a consultant. This is rare—most consultants have never been the customer.

**What I learned:**
- How government actually operates (budgets, politics, stakeholders)
- What it's like to implement software as the customer
- Court operations from the inside (I ran hearings)

## The "Both Sides" Story

This is my unique angle:

```
1. Worked IN government
   - Court Clerk (ran hearings)
   - Deputy Village Clerk
   - Management Analyst
         ↓
2. Implemented software AS the customer
   - Led Tyler Technologies implementation for my village
         ↓
3. Joined the vendor
   - Now I implement that same software for 100+ other organizations
```

**Why this matters:** I understand customers in a way most consultants don't. I've sat in their chair. I've felt their frustrations. I've been on the receiving end of bad implementations.
