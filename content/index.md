## The Longer Version

If you want to actually understand what I do (thanks, Mom 😄), here's the plain-English explanation:

**Customer Success** = After a company buys software, someone needs to make sure they actually use it successfully. That's me. I build relationships with customers, help them solve problems, and make sure they renew.

**Implementation** = When a company buys new software, someone needs to set it up, migrate their data, train their staff, and get them live. That's also me. I've done this 100+ times.

**Enablement** = Training and education programs that help people use software effectively. I design these programs and deliver them.

**B2B SaaS** = Business-to-business software-as-a-service. Companies that sell software to other companies (not consumers). Think Salesforce, not Instagram.

If you spot something, just text/call/email me. Seriously. Even if you're not sure it's a fit—I'd rather hear about 10 maybes than miss one great opportunity.
