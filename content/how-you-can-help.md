# How You Can Help

Seriously, thank you for even reading this. Here are concrete ways you can help, ranked by impact:

## 🏆 Highest Impact

### 1. Make an Introduction

If you know someone at a company I'm targeting (or any B2B software company), a warm intro is worth 100 cold applications.

**What to say:**

> "Hey [Name], my [friend/cousin/etc] Jacob is looking for Customer Success or Implementation roles. He's got 8+ years of experience helping companies adopt software—100+ implementations, really strong track record. Would you be open to a quick chat with him?"

That's it. You don't need to sell me—just open the door.

**Check [[target-companies]] to see if you know anyone at these places.**

### 2. Forward Job Postings

If you see a job posting that looks like a fit, send it to me. Even if you're not sure. I'd rather get 10 "maybes" than miss one good one.

**What to look for:**

- "Customer Success Manager"
- "Implementation Consultant"
- "Solutions Consultant"
- "Onboarding Manager"
- "Customer Enablement"
- "Professional Services"

**At companies that:**

- Sell software to businesses (B2B)
- Are based in Chicago or remote-friendly
- Seem like decent places to work

Just text me the link. That's all you need to do.

## 🎯 Medium Impact

### 3. Share on LinkedIn

If you're comfortable, sharing that I'm looking can reach people I don't know. Here's a post you can copy/paste or modify:

> Looking to help a friend: Jacob Lawrence is exploring Customer Success and Implementation roles in B2B SaaS. He's got 8+ years of experience, 100+ software implementations, and a Master's in Public Administration. Chicago-based, open to remote. If your company is hiring or you know someone who is, reach out to him: linkedin.com/in/jacobalanlawrence

### 4. Tell Me About Your Company

If your company uses business software and you like your Customer Success rep or implementation team—tell me about that company. Even if they're not hiring now, it helps me build my target list.

- What software do you use?
- How was the implementation experience?
- Would you recommend working with their team?

Check out [[my-superpowers]] to see what makes a good CS or Implementation team—you might recognize those qualities in who you work with.

### 5. Let Me Practice

If you're willing to do a mock interview or let me explain what I do, that helps me sharpen my pitch. Just 15-20 minutes over coffee or Zoom.

## 🚫 Probably Not a Fit

To save you time, here's what I'm _not_ looking for:

- **Sales roles** (Account Executive, SDR, BDR) — Not my thing
- **Pure support roles** (Help desk, Tier 1 support) — I've moved past this
- **Consumer companies** (B2C) — My experience is B2B
- **Startups under 20 people** — Too early stage for me right now
- **Commission-heavy compensation** — I prefer base-heavy structures
