**About Alkami:**
Alkami is a leading cloud-based digital banking solutions provider for financial institutions in the United States that helps clients to transform through retail and business banking, digital account opening and loan origination, payment fraud prevention, and data analytics and engagement solutions. Alkami's Mobile App Platform has been certified by J.D. Power for providing clients with "An Outstanding Mobile Banking Platform Experience."

Founded in 2009, we continue to be recognized for our intentional culture and tremendous growth (Best Place to Work in Fintech; Best & Brightest to Work For Nationally; and Comparably's Best Company Culture, Best Career Growth, Best Engineering Team, and Best Places to Work in Dallas, among others).

You will work closely with the Product, Engineering, and Account Management teams to build out processes that streamlines the client onboarding experience for secondary engagements, and for ensuring a smooth experience while adding additional functionality to already-live sites.

- Technical aptitude to learn quickly and rapidly build product knowledge; understanding of web applications (e.g. json, xml, etc) and web services API's (e.g. SOAP, REST, etc.)
- Experience implementing enterprise software solutions
- Experience interfacing with technical teams
- Excellent verbal and written communication skills, both internal and client-facing, with an ability to translate technical requirements into language that is understandable and digestible by different audiences

**Qualifications (Preferred):**
