## Job Description

> Network Detection and Response (NDR) company helping enterprises stay ahead of threats.

```
Customer Success Manager I - Public Sector
Remote
ExtraHop is reinventing Network Detection and Response (NDR) to help enterprises and
organizations stay ahead of emerging threats with unmatched network visibility, context,
and control.

Today's attackers bypass traditional security defenses through identity-based entry,
move invisibly across cloud, on-premise, and data center networks using encryption and
trusted applications, and exploit and exit whenever they want. But all of that movement
is visible on the network... if you can see it.

By combining the power of NDR with Network Performance Management (NPM), Intrusion
Detection Systems (IDS), and forensics in a single, integrated platform, ExtraHop can
decrypt and unlock complete packet-level data at wire speed, analyze and correlate it
across all your networks, applications, devices, and users with cloud-scale machine
learning, and provide a single interface to the SOC to detect, investigate, and
remediate modern cyber risks in real time.

KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
- Analyze customer requirements and promote the highest value application of ExtraHop
- Secure contract renewals and identify growth opportunities
- Engage ExtraHop end-users to provide targeted assistance and enablement
- Assist in assessing customer needs and coordinate high-value services
- Lead and facilitate new customer's initial onboarding
- Assess and document customer health and maturity levels
- Execute direct customer engagement workflows and automated processes
- Contribute to Voice of Customer activities
- Champion customer needs with development teams
- Develop and maintain Customer Success Plans
- Promote customers' use of community platform and self-service capabilities
- Develop deep customer relationships with key stakeholders
- Recognize organic opportunities for expansion/growth
- Host and conduct recurring customer meetings, working sessions, Business Reviews
- Operate as nexus for customer engagement with Sales, Marketing, Product, Support

REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS:
- Four-year college degree, preferably in technical field (MIS or IT)

SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES:
- Work cooperatively with cross-functional stakeholders
- Work well in fast-paced, high-stress environments
- Effective communication skills, verbal and written
- Excellent attention to detail
- Work flexibly with independent initiative and execute CS programs consistently
- Basic knowledge of networking principles (OSI layers 2-4) and application protocols
- Experience with project management is a plus
- Proficient user of Salesforce.com CRM
- Intermediate Microsoft Excel skills

COMPENSATION:
- Base: $90,000 - $100,000
- Commission: 10% of OTE
```

## Why This Role

### Company Interest

- ExtraHop is a leader in NDR space (recognized by Gartner, Forrester, IDC)
- Cybersecurity is mission-critical, especially for public sector
- Product combines NDR + NPM + IDS + forensics in single platform
- Strong analyst recognition suggests solid product-market fit

### Role Fit

- Public sector focus aligns perfectly with my GovTech background
- CSM responsibilities match my Tyler experience almost exactly:
  - Customer Success Plans (did this)
  - Health/maturity assessment (did this with Power BI)
  - Business Reviews (120+ customer engagements)
  - Onboarding (led kickoff through go-live)
  - Voice of Customer (synthesized feedback for product)
  - Cross-functional collaboration (Sales, Product, Support)
- Entry-level CSM I means room to prove myself and grow

### Concerns/Questions

- Cybersecurity domain is new - will need to learn NDR concepts
- "Basic knowledge of networking principles (OSI layers 2-4)" - need to brush up
- Technical depth may be higher than past roles
- 10% commission suggests revenue responsibility

## Resume Used

### Key Points Emphasized

- 5+ years driving product adoption for public sector SaaS customers
- Deep customer relationships with government stakeholders
- Customer Success Plans documenting goals and value expectations
- Customer health and maturity assessment (Power BI dashboards)
- 120+ customer engagements with 4.8/5 satisfaction
- 13 of 14 executive escalations resolved without concessions
- Voice of Customer advocate
- Cross-functional collaboration experience

### Resume Headline

> Customer Success Manager | Public Sector SaaS | Adoption & Retention

---

## Cover Letter

> Tailored to emphasize public sector cybersecurity angle and government experience.

Dear Hiring Manager,

Public sector organizations face unique cybersecurity challenges, and helping them gain visibility into network threats is exactly the kind of mission-critical work I want to be part of. As a Customer Success professional with five years driving adoption and retention for government SaaS customers, plus prior hands-on experience in local government operations, I would bring the dual perspective needed to build deep relationships with ExtraHop's public sector customers and help them realize the full value of the platform.

At Tyler Technologies, I managed portfolios of 12-20 public sector accounts through the full customer lifecycle. I developed Customer Success Plans documenting goals and value expectations, assessed customer health and maturity levels to refine engagement strategy, and delivered 120+ customer engagements including training, Business Reviews, and working sessions with a 4.8/5 satisfaction rating. When issues arose, I resolved 13 of 14 executive escalations without commercial concessions by coordinating cross-functionally with Sales, Product, Support, and partners. I also served as Voice of Customer internally, channeling feedback that shaped product priorities.

What differentiates me is my government-side experience. Before joining Tyler, I worked as a Management Analyst for the Village of Morton Grove, where I led enterprise software adoption across departments and served as client-side project manager for a major system implementation. I understand how government organizations evaluate technology, navigate procurement cycles, and define success. This allows me to meet public sector customers where they are and translate platform capabilities into outcomes that matter to their operations.

ExtraHop's recognition as a leader across Gartner, Forrester, and IDC speaks to both product strength and team execution. I am drawn to an environment where the product delivers real value and the Customer Success team plays a direct role in helping customers stay ahead of threats. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my public sector experience can contribute to ExtraHop's continued growth.

Sincerely,

Jacob Lawrence
