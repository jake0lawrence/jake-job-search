## Job Description

> Customer Solutions Architect - Field Engineering Team

### About the Role

Deeply technical, customer-facing role focused on helping teams deploy and operate Braintrust in production environments. Work with platform, DevOps, and ML infrastructure teams at leading AI-forward organizations.

### Key Responsibilities

**Customer Enablement & Support:**

- Act as trusted advisor for customers deploying and scaling Braintrust in production
- Lead onboarding and implementation engagements (customer-hosted infrastructure, observability pipelines, evaluation workflows, third-party integrations)
- Debug customer issues across layers (SDKs, cloud infrastructure, model outputs)
- Own proactive health checks, upgrade support, and reliability best practices for self-hosted deployments

**Solution Design & Implementation:**

- Design and document end-to-end customer evaluation pipelines using Braintrust SDKs and APIs
- Build technical artifacts (scripts, templates, notebooks) to accelerate onboarding
- Consult on architectural decisions: LLM evaluation, prompt versioning, eval reliability

**Internal Collaboration:**

- Translate customer friction into actionable product feedback
- Partner with sales, support, and engineering on handoffs
- Contribute to internal runbooks and documentation

### Requirements

**Must Have:**

- Customer-facing technical roles (Solutions Architect, Forward Deployed Engineer, etc.)
- Fluency in Python or TypeScript; comfort debugging code, APIs, infrastructure
- Strong DevOps/cloud architecture knowledge (Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Ability to explain technical concepts to engineers and non-technical stakeholders
- Comfortable working autonomously in fast-paced startup environment

**Nice to Have:**

- Self-hosted or hybrid SaaS deployment experience
- Familiarity with LLM/AI development workflows
- CI/CD pipelines and networking/security best practices

---

## Why This Role

### Company Interest

- **Mission alignment:** Solving the exact problem I encountered building AI workflows — "without visibility into how AI behaves in production, you're flying blind"
- **Customer base:** Working with elite engineering teams (Notion, Stripe, Zapier, Vercel)
- **Market timing:** AI observability is critical infrastructure as LLMs go to production
- **Startup stage:** Small team (11-50), broad ownership, high impact

### Role Fit

- **Direct experience match:** 100+ deployments across managed cloud, self-hosted, and hybrid
- **AI expertise:** Co-founded AI Transformation Initiative; built LLM evaluation pipelines
- **Technical depth:** Python, SDKs, APIs, cloud infrastructure debugging
- **Customer success:** 120+ enablement sessions, 4.8/5 satisfaction, escalation resolution

### Concerns/Questions

- Salary not disclosed — need to understand comp range
- What's the on-call/support rotation structure?
- What percentage of customers are self-hosted vs managed cloud?
- What's the current team size for Field Engineering?
