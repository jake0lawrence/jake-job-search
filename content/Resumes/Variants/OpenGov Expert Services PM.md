2. Direct EAM experience (CentralSquare rollout, SAP EAM implementation)
3. ArcGIS hands-on experience and GIS integration
4. Playbook author (Cutover, Training, Integration/Conversion Intake)
5. Data conversion expertise (37% improvement in sign-off time)

## Key Bullet Points Used

### Summary Section
> GovTech implementation leader (court CMS) with 100 municipal go-lives delivered and a steady portfolio of 12–20 concurrent clients. Known for white-glove customer advocacy, crisp cadences, and cross-functional orchestration (conversion, integrations, product, support). Heavy user of Microsoft Dynamics (daily), JIRA (daily), PSA (daily), Confluence (KB authoring); hands-on ArcGIS and prior EAM experience (CentralSquare, SAP). I build playbooks, surface risk early, and turn "stuck" accounts into referenceable outcomes.

### Selected Results
- 100 municipal go-lives; ~92% on-time and 95% on-budget across the last 24 months
- Data-conversion sign-off improved 24 → 15 business days (-37%) via intake checklist, early sample extracts, and mapping workshops
- 14 executive escalations handled; 13 resolved without commercial concessions; average resolution ~10 business days
- 120+ admin training sessions for ~650 attendees; training CSAT 4.8/5; first-30-day office hours reduced early hypercare backlog
- Core playbooks (Cutover, Training/Enablement, Integration/Conversion Intake) adopted on ~87% of projects; rework -28%; hypercare -5.5 days
- Post-go-live conversion defects ≤ 0.7 per 1,000 migrated records; interface rejects <0.4% of transactions after tuning

### EAM-Specific Bullets (Morton Grove)
- Co-led CentralSquare EAM rollout for Public Works; stood up asset/work-order models, PM schedules, and GL tie-outs; reduced work-order backlog ~20% and increased PM compliance to ~85% within two quarters
- Partnered with GIS to publish ArcGIS layers (assets, service lines, work zones) and embed maps into EAM workflows for location-aware dispatch

### Notable Phrasing Choices
- "White-glove customer advocacy" — Premium service positioning
- "Turn 'stuck' accounts into referenceable outcomes" — Problem-solver identity
- "Plays & Automations" section — Shows systematic thinking
- "Selected Project Snapshots (STAR)" — Interview-ready stories included

## Interview Preparation

### Key Themes to Hit
1. **EAM expertise:** "I've implemented CentralSquare and SAP EAM—I know the domain"
2. **Process builder:** "I create playbooks that improve outcomes: 28% less rework, 37% faster sign-off"
3. **Quality obsessed:** "<0.7 defects per 1,000 records—I care about precision"
4. **Problem solver:** "I turn stuck accounts into references—RMS, GL disputes, SSO issues"

### Likely Questions & Angles
| Question | Your Angle |
|----------|------------|
| "Tell me about your EAM experience" | CentralSquare rollout at Morton Grove—asset models, PM schedules, GL tie-outs, ArcGIS integration |
| "How do you handle data conversion challenges?" | Intake checklist, early sample extracts, mapping workshops—37% improvement |
| "Describe a project you turned around" | RMS ingest failures—coordinated API dev, added retries/alerting, 95% reduction in failures |
| "What playbooks have you created?" | Cutover, Training/Enablement, Integration/Conversion Intake—87% adoption, 28% less rework |

### Questions to Ask Them
- "What does the Expert Services career path look like?"
- "How are you thinking about the EAM market opportunity?"
- "What's the typical engagement model for Expert Services vs. standard implementation?"

## Cover Letter Hooks

### Opening Hook
> I build playbooks, surface risk early, and turn "stuck" accounts into referenceable outcomes. With 100 municipal go-lives and hands-on EAM experience (CentralSquare, SAP, ArcGIS), I'm targeting OpenGov's Expert Services Program Manager role.

### Differentiator Paragraph
> What makes me particularly relevant for the EAM focus is that I've actually implemented these systems. At Morton Grove, I co-led a CentralSquare EAM rollout—building asset models, PM schedules, and GL tie-outs from scratch. I partnered with GIS to embed ArcGIS layers into workflows for location-aware dispatch. This isn't theoretical knowledge; I've done the work.

### Closing Hook
> I'd love to bring my implementation expertise and EAM domain knowledge to OpenGov's Expert Services team, helping government clients maximize value from their asset management investments.
