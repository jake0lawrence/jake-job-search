## Cover Letter Hooks

### Opening Hook

> I've spent my career helping government agencies adopt technology that improves how they serve residents. With 100+ municipal court deployments under my belt, I understand the unique challenges—and opportunities—that come with GovTech.

### Differentiator Paragraph

> PayIt's mission resonates with me because I've seen firsthand how outdated payment systems frustrate both government staff and the residents they serve. I've worked in local government offices where we processed payments manually, and I've helped courts modernize those exact workflows. I know what success looks like on both sides of the table.

### Closing Hook

> I'd love to bring my GovTech expertise and customer success mindset to PayIt, helping government agencies deliver better payment experiences for their communities.
