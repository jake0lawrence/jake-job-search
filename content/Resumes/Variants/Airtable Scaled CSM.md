- Tech-forward culture values automation and data
- High-growth environment with builder opportunities
- Product you can personally use and advocate for

### What They're Looking For

- Comfort with no-code tools and automation mindset

## Positioning Strategy

### Headline/Branding

> Scaled Customer Success Manager

### Tagline

> Scaled Success (pooled portfolio, time-bound onboarding, digital programs) | Adoption + Value Realization (90-day launch plans, health signals, intervention playbooks) | Renewal Readiness (EBRs, value capture, risk mitigation, expansion identification)

### Core Narrative

Position as a scaled CS practitioner who already operates in the exact model Airtable uses. Emphasize pooled portfolio experience, 1:many programs, and health-based prioritization. Show comfort with no-code tools by listing Airtable itself in your toolkit.

### Key Differentiators for This Role

1. Pooled portfolio model (~100 accounts/year, 20 concurrent)
2. 90-day launch plans with clear milestones
3. Health signal operationalization (1-2 weeks earlier detection)
4. 1:many programs adopted across 87% of portfolio
5. No-code tool familiarity (Airtable, Notion, Zapier, Make, n8n)

## Interview Preparation

### Key Themes to Hit

1. **Scaled mindset:** "I already work in the pooled model—this isn't a transition for me"
2. **Data-driven:** "I operationalize health signals, I don't just track them"
3. **Builder:** "I create programs that scale—87% adoption proves they work"
4. **No-code native:** "I use Airtable, Notion, Zapier daily—I'm a power user"

### Likely Questions & Angles

| Question                                     | Your Angle                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "How do you prioritize in a pooled model?"   | Health signals + intervention playbooks; show the system                |
| "Tell me about a 1:many program you built"   | Webinars, office hours, self-serve guides—87% adoption, 4.8/5           |
| "How do you measure success at scale?"       | Health dashboards, adoption metrics, time-to-value (90 days)            |
| "What's your experience with no-code tools?" | Daily user of Airtable, Notion, Zapier; Power Automate in previous role |

### Questions to Ask Them

- "What does your health scoring model look like today?"
- "How does the scaled CS team partner with high-touch CSMs?"
- "What's the biggest gap in your current 1:many programming?"
