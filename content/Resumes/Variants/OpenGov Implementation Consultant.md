Proven ability to manage multiple concurrent implementations while maintaining high customer satisfaction and delivery quality. MPA-trained with hands-on experience in municipal operations.

## Interview Preparation

### Key Themes to Hit
1. **Scale:** "100+ implementations—I know how to deliver at volume"
2. **Government native:** "MPA + municipal government employment—I understand their world"
3. **Full lifecycle:** "Requirements through go-live and adoption—I own the whole journey"
4. **Quality:** "92% on-time, 4.8/5 CSAT—I deliver results"

### Likely Questions & Angles
| Question | Your Angle |
|----------|------------|
| "Why OpenGov?" | "I believe in the mission—government transparency matters. And I want to bring my implementation expertise to a growing platform." |
| "Tell me about your implementation methodology" | Requirements gathering → configuration → data migration → training → go-live → adoption support |
| "How do you manage multiple concurrent projects?" | Prioritization frameworks, status cadences, risk logs, escalation protocols |
| "What's your experience with government stakeholders?" | City Clerks, IT Directors, Department Heads—fluent in their language and constraints |

### Questions to Ask Them
- "What does a typical implementation timeline look like for your products?"
- "How does the PS team collaborate with Product on customer feedback?"
- "What's the biggest implementation challenge your customers face?"

## Cover Letter Hooks

### Opening Hook
> I've spent 5+ years doing exactly what this role requires: leading end-to-end software implementations for local government clients. With 100+ successful deployments under my belt, I understand what it takes to translate complex municipal requirements into working solutions.

### Differentiator Paragraph

Before joining Tyler, I worked as a Management Analyst for two Illinois municipalities, implementing the same types of systems I now deploy. I've sat in the budget meetings, navigated the procurement processes, and experienced the stakeholder dynamics firsthand.

### Closing Hook
