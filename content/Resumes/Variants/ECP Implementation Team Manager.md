## Interview Preparation

### Key Themes to Hit
1. **Process builder:** "I create the playbooks and processes that enable consistent delivery"
2. **Team enabler:** "I mentor consultants and help them ramp to productivity"
3. **Metrics-driven:** "92% on-time, 95% on-budget—I track and hit commitments"
4. **Escalation leader:** "I'm the escalation point—13/14 resolved without concessions"

### Likely Questions & Angles
| Question | Your Angle |
|----------|------------|
| "Tell me about your management experience" | Mentoring, process documentation, escalation point—de facto team leadership |
| "How do you ensure delivery quality at scale?" | Playbooks, dashboards, governance cadences, proactive risk detection |
| "How do you handle an underperforming team member?" | Clear expectations, coaching, documentation, support to succeed |
| "What's your approach to process improvement?" | Identify bottlenecks, create playbooks, measure adoption, iterate |

### Questions to Ask Them
- "What does success look like for the implementation team in the next 12 months?"
- "How does the team currently handle escalations?"
- "What's the biggest process gap you're hoping a manager can address?"

## Cover Letter Hooks

### Opening Hook
> I build the processes that enable teams to deliver consistently. Over the past 5+ years, I've created onboarding playbooks adopted across 87% of accounts, maintained 92% on-time delivery, and served as the escalation point for our highest-impact customer issues.

### Differentiator Paragraph
> What energizes me about the Implementation Team Manager role is the opportunity to multiply impact through people. I've already done this informally—mentoring new consultants, documenting processes, leading escalation resolution. Now I'm ready to formalize that into a management role where I can uplift and enable an entire team.

### Closing Hook
> I'd love to bring my process discipline, delivery metrics, and team enablement mindset to ECP, helping your implementation team deliver world-class customer experiences.
