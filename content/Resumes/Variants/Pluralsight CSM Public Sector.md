## Cover Letter Hooks

### Opening Hook

> Public sector customers are different. They have longer procurement cycles, more stakeholders, and higher accountability. I've spent my career in this world—first as a local government employee, then helping 100+ government agencies adopt complex technology.

### Differentiator Paragraph

> What I bring to Pluralsight is a data-driven approach to retention. I don't wait for churn signals—I build health dashboards that flag at-risk accounts 1-2 weeks earlier, giving me time to intervene before problems become escalations. When escalations do happen, I resolve them: 13 of 14 without commercial concessions.

### Closing Hook

> I'd love to bring my public sector expertise and retention-focused mindset to Pluralsight, helping your government clients develop the skills they need to serve their communities.
