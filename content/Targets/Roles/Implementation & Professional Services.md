## Interview Preparation

### Key Themes to Hit
1. **Scale:** "100+ implementations with 92% on-time delivery"
2. **Methodology:** "I create playbooks that improve delivery for everyone"
3. **Technical + soft:** "I handle data migration AND stakeholder management"
4. **Quality:** "My conversion process improvement reduced defects to <0.1%"

### Likely Questions
| Question | Your Angle |
|----------|------------|
| "Walk me through your implementation methodology" | Discovery → config → migration → training → go-live → hypercare |
| "How do you handle scope creep?" | Clear governance, change control, stakeholder alignment |
| "Tell me about a challenging implementation" | RMS integration fix—technical crisis management |
| "How do you ensure adoption post-go-live?" | First 30 Days program, office hours, health monitoring |

### Questions to Ask Them
- "What does a typical implementation timeline look like?"
- "How are implementations staffed (solo vs. team)?"
- "What's the technical complexity of your implementations?"
- "How do you measure implementation success?"
