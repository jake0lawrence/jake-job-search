## Interview Preparation

### Key Themes to Hit
1. **Government DNA:** "I've been on both sides—as a government employee and serving government clients"
2. **Operational understanding:** "I've spent hundreds of hours in court proceedings"
3. **Scale + depth:** "100+ government implementations, but I understand each is unique"
4. **Patience + persistence:** "Government moves differently—I know how to navigate that"

### Likely Questions
| Question | Your Angle |
|----------|------------|
| "What's unique about government clients?" | Procurement, stakeholders, compliance, timeline expectations |
| "Tell me about a difficult government implementation" | Stakeholder complexity, political dynamics, patience |
| "How do you handle slow government decision-making?" | Build relationships, demonstrate value incrementally, stay patient |
| "What's your experience with [specific government area]?" | Deep on courts; broad on municipal operations |

### Questions to Ask Them
- "What's your typical sales cycle with government clients?"
- "How do you handle procurement requirements?"
- "What's the mix of state vs. local government clients?"
- "How technical are your government implementations?"
