- Experience managing 50-200+ accounts simultaneously

- Automation mindset (but not necessarily technical)
- Startup/growth-stage comfort

| "How do you maintain quality at scale?"       | Clear milestones, self-serve resources, escalation criteria      |
| "What's your experience with CS platforms?"   | Power BI for health monitoring; eager to use Gainsight/ChurnZero |

### Questions to Ask Them
