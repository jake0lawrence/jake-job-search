# First 30 Days Adoption Program

## One-Liner

> Designed "First 30 Days" onboarding program with role-based training tracks and office hours, reducing time-to-value and early support tickets while achieving 4.8/5 satisfaction.

---

## Full Context

### The Situation

The first 30 days after go-live are critical for adoption success. Users are forming habits, encountering initial friction, and deciding whether to embrace or resist the new system. Without structured support, early struggles lead to disengagement and increased support burden.

### Your Role

Designed comprehensive post-go-live adoption program covering the critical first 30 days. Created role-based training tracks, quick-reference materials, and office hours support model.

### The Approach

- Mapped the post-go-live user journey: what do users need in days 1-7, 8-14, 15-30?
- Created role-based training tracks:
  - **Administrators:** Configuration, user management, reporting
  - **Power users:** Advanced workflows, troubleshooting, efficiency tips
  - **Casual users:** Core tasks, quick reference, where to get help
- Developed quick-hit enablement assets: cheat sheets, video walkthroughs, FAQ
- Launched office hours model: scheduled drop-in sessions for questions
- Built feedback loop to iterate based on common questions and struggles

### The Outcome

Higher admin confidence in first 30 days. Fewer hypercare tickets. 4.8/5 satisfaction on training. Office hours became standard practice adopted across team.

## Interview Preparation

### STAR Format

**Situation:**
Post-go-live was chaotic for customers—users struggled with basics, support tickets spiked, and adoption stalled. The critical first 30 days weren't being structured for success.

**Task:**
Design a program that would guide users through the first 30 days, build confidence, and reduce early support burden.

**Action:**

- Mapped user journey: what do different roles need at different points?
- Created role-based training tracks with appropriate depth
- Developed quick-reference materials for common tasks
- Launched office hours as low-friction support channel
- Built feedback loop to identify and address common struggles
- Documented program for team adoption

**Result:**
4.8/5 satisfaction. Reduced hypercare tickets. Faster time-to-proficiency. Office hours model adopted as team standard.

### Likely Follow-up Questions

1. "How did you determine what to include in each role's track?"
2. "What made office hours effective?"
3. "How do you scale this across many customers?"
4. "How did you measure time-to-value improvement?"

### Potential Challenges/Objections

| Concern                                          | Response                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "This sounds resource-intensive"                 | Office hours serve multiple customers simultaneously. Materials are reusable. Investment pays off in reduced support burden.      |
| "How do you handle customers who skip training?" | Self-serve materials available anytime. Office hours catch those who need help later. Track engagement to identify at-risk users. |
