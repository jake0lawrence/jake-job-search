# 100+ Municipal Court Implementations

## One-Liner

> Led 100+ end-to-end software implementations for municipal courts and government agencies, maintaining 92% on-time and 95% on-budget delivery.

---

## Full Context

### The Situation
Tyler Technologies serves municipal courts, administrative hearing departments, and government agencies with case management software. Each implementation involves complex stakeholder dynamics, legacy data migration, integration requirements, and change management across diverse user groups.

### Your Role
End-to-end implementation ownership from discovery through go-live and post-launch stabilization. Primary point of contact for customers throughout the project lifecycle. Coordinated cross-functional resources across conversion, integrations, product, and support teams.

### The Approach
- Conducted discovery workshops to understand court workflows and requirements
- Developed detailed project plans with milestones, owners, and success criteria
- Managed data conversion including offense code mapping and legacy system migration
- Configured integrations with e-ticketing, probation, RMS, and financial systems
- Delivered role-based training to court staff (administrators, clerks, hearing officers)
- Ran cutover planning, UAT coordination, and go-live support
- Provided hypercare support and adoption monitoring post-launch

### The Outcome
Consistently successful deployments across diverse court environments. Built reputation as trusted advisor to court administrators and government officials. Created playbooks adopted across 87% of projects that improved delivery consistency for entire team.

## Interview Preparation

### STAR Format

**Situation:**
Tyler Technologies needed implementation consultants who could manage complex municipal court deployments with diverse stakeholders—judges, prosecutors, clerks, IT directors, and elected officials—each with different priorities and technical comfort levels.

**Task:**
Own end-to-end implementation success: discovery, configuration, data migration, training, go-live, and stabilization. Maintain delivery quality while managing 12-20 concurrent projects.

**Action:**
- Built structured project governance with clear milestones and accountability
- Created stakeholder-specific communication and training approaches
- Developed playbooks (Cutover, Training, Conversion) that standardized delivery
- Coordinated cross-functional resources across conversion, integrations, and support
- Established office hours model for post-go-live adoption support

**Result:**
Delivered 100+ successful implementations with 92% on-time and 95% on-budget performance. Playbooks adopted across 87% of team projects. Multiple accounts became reference customers.

### Likely Follow-up Questions
1. "What made these implementations complex?"
2. "How did you handle a project that was going off track?"
3. "How did you manage so many concurrent projects?"
4. "Tell me about a stakeholder conflict you navigated."

### Potential Challenges/Objections
| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "100+ sounds like a lot—were these small projects?" | Mix of sizes; some were single departments, others multi-agency. Complexity varied but all required full lifecycle management. |
| "Were you solo or part of a team?" | Primary owner accountable for each, but coordinated cross-functional resources (data conversion, integrations, support). |

## Reflection

**What went well:**
- Stakeholder relationship building became a differentiator
- Playbook creation scaled personal impact across team
- Developed deep court operations expertise

**What you'd do differently:**
- Earlier investment in automation for status reporting
- More systematic capture of lessons learned per project

**Unexpected lessons:**
- Government stakeholders value transparency and reliability over speed
- Building relationships with clerks (not just executives) is critical for adoption
