## Interview Preparation

### STAR Format

**Situation:**
Morton Grove was implementing Tyler Municipal Justice for Administrative Hearings. As a municipality, we needed someone to own the customer side—requirements, vendor management, testing, adoption.

**Task:**
Serve as client-side PM ensuring successful implementation and adoption.

**Action:**
- Led internal requirements gathering
- Coordinated with Tyler consultants and held them accountable
- Managed data migration from legacy systems
- Oversaw UAT with court staff
- Led change management and training
- Managed go-live and cutover

**Result:**
Successful on-time go-live. Staff adopted system. Gained customer perspective that shaped my approach when I later joined Tyler and implemented the same system 100+ times.

### Likely Follow-up Questions
1. "What did you learn as a customer that you applied as a vendor?"
2. "How did this experience influence how you treat your customers?"
3. "What would you have done differently as the customer?"

### Potential Challenges/Objections
| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "One implementation as customer isn't much" | Agreed—but it's the perspective that matters. I know what it feels like to be on the receiving end. That empathy shows in every customer interaction. |

## Strategic Value

**This is a powerful narrative:**
1. Worked IN a court (Court Clerk)
2. Implemented court software AS the customer
3. Joined the vendor
4. Implemented the same software 100+ times

Very few candidates can tell this story. Use it to demonstrate customer empathy and operational credibility.
