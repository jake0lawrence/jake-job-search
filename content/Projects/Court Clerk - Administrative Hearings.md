## Interview Preparation

### STAR Format

**Situation:**
Morton Grove Administrative Hearings Department needed a Court Clerk to manage daily operations, support hearings, and ensure procedural compliance.

**Task:**
Serve as Court Clerk while also performing Management Analyst duties—balancing operational responsibilities with strategic projects.

**Action:**
- Managed case dockets and hearing schedules
- Prepared materials and supported hearing proceedings
- Coordinated with hearing officers, police, attorneys
- Ensured procedural compliance and documentation
- Applied operational insights to technology implementation (Tyler Municipal Justice)

**Result:**
Hundreds of hours of court operations experience. Deep understanding of court workflows and stakeholder dynamics. Direct experience that made me a more effective court system consultant.

### Likely Follow-up Questions
1. "What did you learn from being in the court vs. implementing court software?"
2. "How did this experience change your approach to implementations?"
3. "What surprised you about court operations?"

### Potential Challenges/Objections
| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "Court Clerk sounds administrative" | It is—but that's the point. Understanding operations from inside made me better at technology implementations. I've seen court workflows from both sides. |
| "This was years ago" | Yes, but the experience informed 100+ subsequent implementations. I bring customer-side perspective to every project. |
