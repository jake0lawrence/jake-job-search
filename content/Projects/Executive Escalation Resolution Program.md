# Executive Escalation Resolution Program

## One-Liner

> Resolved 13 of 14 executive escalations without commercial concessions, averaging ~10 business days to resolution through cross-functional partnership and proactive customer advocacy.

---

## Full Context

### The Situation
Enterprise implementations inevitably encounter issues that escalate to executive level—product gaps, integration failures, timeline delays, or stakeholder dissatisfaction. These situations threaten revenue, reputation, and customer relationships. They require rapid assessment, cross-functional coordination, and executive-level communication.

### Your Role
Primary escalation owner responsible for assessment, action planning, cross-functional coordination, customer communication, and resolution. Accountable for protecting the customer relationship while representing company interests.

### The Approach
- Rapid triage: assess severity, identify root causes, map stakeholders
- Create save plan with clear actions, owners, and timelines
- Coordinate cross-functional resources (Product, Engineering, Support, Sales)
- Establish regular communication cadence with customer executives
- Address root causes, not just symptoms
- Document resolution and lessons learned

### The Outcome
93% resolution rate without commercial concessions (13/14). Average resolution time of ~10 business days. Multiple at-risk accounts converted to reference customers. Escalation handling documented in playbooks for team use.

## Interview Preparation

### STAR Format

**Situation:**
Enterprise customer with executive-level escalation—multiple issues spanning product, implementation, and support. Renewal at risk. Customer threatening to go to market.

**Task:**
Resolve issues, rebuild trust, and protect the account without offering commercial concessions that would set problematic precedents.

**Action:**
- Conducted rapid assessment: mapped all open issues, identified root causes, categorized by owner
- Created save plan with 10-day action timeline
- Coordinated daily standups with Product, Engineering, and Support
- Established twice-weekly executive updates with customer VP
- Addressed issues systematically while rebuilding relationship through transparency
- Documented resolution path and shared with customer leadership

**Result:**
All critical issues resolved within 10 business days. No commercial concessions required. Customer renewed and expanded. Became reference account for similar prospects.

### Likely Follow-up Questions
1. "What was the one escalation you couldn't resolve?"
2. "How do you know when to offer concessions vs. hold firm?"
3. "How did you get cross-functional teams to prioritize your escalation?"
4. "How do you manage customer expectations during escalations?"

### Potential Challenges/Objections
| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "What about the 1 you didn't resolve?" | Complex product gap requiring roadmap change; customer chose to exit. Relationship remained positive; clean transition. |
| "No concessions seems unrealistic" | Focus on addressing root causes vs. treating symptoms. Most escalations stem from execution or communication failures, not commercial terms. |
