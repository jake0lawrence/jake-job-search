# Illinois Vehicle Code Reconciliation

## One-Liner

> Reconciled offense codes across legacy systems, municipal ordinances, and Illinois Vehicle Code sections for dozens of Illinois courts—developing deep regulatory expertise through implementation work.

---

## Full Context

### The Situation
Illinois courts migrating to new case management systems face a complex challenge: legacy offense codes don't align with current Illinois Vehicle Code (IVC) sections or municipal ordinances. Each court has its own historical coding conventions. New systems require standardized offense classifications.

### Your Role
Led offense code reconciliation across dozens of Illinois court implementations. Translated between legacy codes, municipal ordinances, and IVC sections. Configured systems with standardized offense structures.

### The Approach
- Analyzed legacy offense code structures for each court
- Mapped legacy codes to current IVC sections
- Reconciled municipal ordinances with state code
- Created standardized offense classification tables
- Configured systems with proper code mappings
- Validated with court staff and legal reviewers
- Documented mappings for future reference

### The Outcome
Successful data migration with standardized offense codes. Deep IVC expertise developed through practical application. Ability to discuss regulatory details with court administrators and hearing officers.
