# Pooled Portfolio Model

## One-Liner

> Managed pooled portfolio model supporting ~100 accounts/year through time-bound onboarding, health-based prioritization, and 1:many programs—achieving 87% adoption with 4.8/5 satisfaction without proportional headcount increase.

---

## Full Context

### The Situation
Customer base was growing faster than headcount. Traditional high-touch model wasn't scalable. Needed to support more customers without sacrificing outcomes. Required new engagement model balancing efficiency with effectiveness.

### Your Role
Operated within and helped refine pooled portfolio model. Managed 20 concurrent active engagements. Built and delivered 1:many programs. Used health-based prioritization to focus effort where needed most.

### The Approach
- **Pooled coverage:** Shared responsibility for customer portfolio vs. dedicated ownership
- **Time-bound onboarding:** 90-day launch milestones with clear handoffs
- **Health-based prioritization:** Used signals to identify customers needing attention
- **1:many programs:** Webinars, office hours, playbooks, self-serve content
- **Digital touchpoints:** Automated outreach for routine engagement
- **Escalation triggers:** Clear criteria for when to go high-touch

### The Outcome
~100 accounts/year supported through pooled model. 87% adoption of enablement content. 4.8/5 satisfaction maintained. Demonstrated that scaled model can deliver quality outcomes.

## Interview Preparation

### STAR Format

**Situation:**
Customer base growing faster than headcount. Traditional high-touch model wasn't sustainable. Needed to support more customers without sacrificing quality.

**Task:**
Operate effectively within pooled model while contributing to its refinement.

**Action:**
- Managed 20 concurrent engagements through health-based prioritization
- Drove 90-day launch milestones for time-bound onboarding
- Built and delivered 1:many programs (webinars, office hours)
- Created reusable playbooks and self-serve content
- Used health signals to focus effort on at-risk accounts
- Contributed to model improvement through feedback and iteration

**Result:**
~100 accounts/year supported. 87% content adoption. 4.8/5 satisfaction maintained. Proved scaled model viability.

### Likely Follow-up Questions
1. "How do you prioritize across 20 concurrent accounts?"
2. "What makes 1:many programs effective?"
3. "How do you maintain quality at scale?"
4. "When do you go high-touch vs. stay scaled?"

### Potential Challenges/Objections
| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "Scaled CS sounds like less personal service" | It's about smart prioritization, not less care. High-need accounts get high-touch. Healthy accounts get efficient support. Everyone gets what they need. |
| "How do you build relationships in a pooled model?" | Relationships form through value delivery. Office hours, webinars, and timely interventions build trust. Ownership matters less than responsiveness. |
