# CentralSquare EAM Rollout

## One-Liner

> Co-led CentralSquare EAM rollout for Public Works, configuring asset/work-order models, integrating with GIS, and training 40+ staff—reducing work-order backlog 20% and improving PM compliance to 85%.

---

## Full Context

### The Situation
Village of Morton Grove Public Works was managing assets and work orders through spreadsheets and paper processes. No preventive maintenance tracking. Growing backlog of work orders. No visibility into asset conditions or maintenance history. Leadership wanted to modernize operations.

### Your Role
Co-led implementation from requirements through go-live. Responsible for system configuration, GIS integration, training development, and change management. Partnered with Public Works leadership and IT throughout.

### The Approach
- Conducted discovery with Public Works: asset inventory, work order processes, pain points
- Designed asset hierarchy and work order classifications
- Configured CentralSquare EAM:
  - Asset models (vehicles, infrastructure, equipment)
  - Work order workflows (request → assignment → completion)
  - Preventive maintenance schedules
  - GL tie-outs for cost tracking
- Partnered with GIS team to integrate ArcGIS layers:
  - Asset locations
  - Service lines
  - Work zones
- Developed training materials for field and office staff
- Trained 40+ users across field crews and supervisors
- Established ongoing support and adoption monitoring

### The Outcome
Work order backlog reduced ~20% within two quarters. PM compliance improved to ~85%. Field crews adopted mobile workflows. GIS integration enabled location-aware dispatch. Foundation for continued asset management maturity.

## Interview Preparation

### STAR Format

**Situation:**
Public Works was managing assets and work orders through spreadsheets and paper. No preventive maintenance tracking. Growing backlog. No visibility into asset conditions.

**Task:**
Implement enterprise asset management system that would modernize operations, reduce backlog, and establish maintenance discipline.

**Action:**
- Conducted discovery with Public Works leadership
- Designed asset hierarchy and work order classifications
- Configured CentralSquare EAM with PM schedules and GL integration
- Partnered with GIS to integrate asset location layers
- Developed training for field crews (mobile) and office staff
- Trained 40+ users and supported adoption

**Result:**
Work order backlog reduced 20% within two quarters. PM compliance improved to 85%. Field crews adopted mobile workflows. GIS integration enabled smarter dispatch.

### Likely Follow-up Questions
1. "How did you get field crews to adopt the new system?"
2. "What was the biggest challenge in this implementation?"
3. "How did you design the asset hierarchy?"
4. "What role did GIS integration play?"

### Potential Challenges/Objections
| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "Field crews often resist technology" | Involved crew leaders in design. Mobile app was easier than paper. Showed how it made their jobs easier, not harder. |
| "20% backlog reduction—how measured?" | Tracked open work orders before and after. Reduction came from better prioritization and PM preventing reactive work. |

## Strategic Value

This project shows:
- **Hands-on EAM experience** (not just implementation consulting)
- **GIS integration capability**
- **Field operations understanding**
- **Public Works domain knowledge**

**Best for:** Asset management, utilities, infrastructure, public works technology roles

## Reflection

**What went well:**
- GIS integration was a differentiator
- Field crew involvement drove adoption
- PM schedules created immediate value

**What you'd do differently:**
- More time on data cleanup before go-live
- Earlier mobile device deployment

**Unexpected lessons:**
- Asset management is as much about culture as technology
- PM compliance requires ongoing reinforcement
