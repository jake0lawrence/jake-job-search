# Status Pack Automation

## One-Liner

> Automated weekly status reporting across Dynamics, JIRA, and PSA, saving 8-10 hours/week of manual prep and surfacing risks 1-2 weeks earlier.

---

## Full Context

### The Situation
Weekly status reporting required manually pulling data from three systems (Dynamics, JIRA, PSA), normalizing formats, and compiling into status packs for PMs and leadership. This consumed 8-10 hours/week and was error-prone. By the time reports were compiled, data was already stale.

### Your Role
Identified automation opportunity, designed normalized data model, built Power BI solution that automated report generation, and implemented team-wide.

### The Approach
- Mapped data sources and report requirements
- Identified fields needed from each system (Dynamics, JIRA, PSA)
- Designed normalized data model that could combine across systems
- Built Power BI dashboard with:
  - Automated data refresh
  - Executive summary view
  - Drill-down to project and account level
  - Risk indicators and thresholds
- Created weekly digest format for PM distribution
- Trained team on using automated reports

### The Outcome
Eliminated 8-10 hours/week of manual status prep. Risks surfaced 1-2 weeks earlier due to real-time data. Improved capacity forecasting. Reports became standard tool for project governance.

## Metrics & Impact

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Time saved | 8-10 hrs/week | Manual prep eliminated |
| Earlier risk detection | 1-2 weeks | Real-time vs. weekly manual |
| Systems integrated | 3 | Dynamics, JIRA, PSA |
| Team adoption | Full | Standard reporting tool |

### Before/After Comparison
| Dimension | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Prep time | 8-10 hrs/week | <30 min/week |
| Data freshness | 1 week old | Real-time |
| Error rate | Manual errors common | Automated, consistent |
| Risk visibility | Delayed | Immediate |

## Interview Preparation

### STAR Format

**Situation:**
Weekly status reporting consumed 8-10 hours of manual data gathering and compilation across Dynamics, JIRA, and PSA. Reports were often stale by the time they were distributed.

**Task:**
Automate status reporting to save time and improve data freshness.

**Action:**
- Mapped data requirements across three source systems
- Designed normalized data model for cross-system integration
- Built Power BI solution with automated refresh and risk thresholds
- Created executive summary and drill-down views
- Trained team on using automated reports
- Established process for maintaining and improving

**Result:**
8-10 hours/week saved. Risks visible 1-2 weeks earlier. Reports became standard tool for project governance. Improved team capacity for customer-facing work.

### Likely Follow-up Questions
1. "What technical challenges did you face integrating three systems?"
2. "How did you ensure data quality across sources?"
3. "How did you get the team to adopt the new reports?"
4. "What would you do differently?"

### Potential Challenges/Objections
| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "8-10 hours seems high for status reporting" | Multiple PMs, multiple projects, three systems. Includes data gathering, normalization, formatting, and distribution. |
| "Why not just use one system for everything?" | Legacy systems with different purposes. Integration was more practical than migration. |

## Reflection

**What went well:**
- Quick win that demonstrated value of automation
- Built skills in cross-system data integration
- Created template for future automation efforts

**What you'd do differently:**
- Earlier investment in proper data warehouse vs. direct connections
- More automated distribution (vs. manual sharing)

**Unexpected lessons:**
- Automation projects have compounding returns
- Standardized data model is the hard part—visualization is easy
