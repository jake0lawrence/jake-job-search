# Customer Health Dashboard System

## One-Liner

> Built Power BI dashboards integrating Dynamics, JIRA, and PSA data to track customer health and flag at-risk accounts 1-2 weeks earlier than previous methods.

---

## Full Context

### The Situation

Customer risk was being identified reactively—often after issues had already escalated. Data existed across multiple systems (Dynamics CRM, JIRA, PSA) but wasn't consolidated or actionable. Leadership needed visibility into portfolio health; consultants needed early warning signals.

### Your Role

Designed and built dashboard system that consolidated data across systems, defined health indicators, established thresholds for intervention, and created operational workflows for using insights.

### The Approach

- Mapped data sources: Dynamics (account data), JIRA (issues, progress), PSA (resource allocation, timeline)
- Defined health indicators: milestone completion, open issues, stakeholder engagement, risk flags
- Built Power BI dashboards with drill-down capability
- Established thresholds that triggered intervention playbooks
- Created executive summary views for leadership visibility
- Trained team on dashboard usage and interpretation

### The Outcome

At-risk accounts identified 1-2 weeks earlier. Intervention playbooks triggered automatically based on health signals. Dashboards used in executive communications and steering committees. Contributed to 92% on-time delivery performance.

## Interview Preparation

### STAR Format

**Situation:**
Customer risk was being identified too late—often after escalation. Data existed across Dynamics, JIRA, and PSA but wasn't consolidated. Leadership lacked portfolio visibility. Consultants were reactive rather than proactive.

**Task:**
Build a health monitoring system that would surface risk earlier and enable proactive intervention.

**Action:**

- Mapped data across three source systems
- Defined health indicators based on implementation experience (milestones, issues, engagement)
- Built Power BI dashboards with account-level and portfolio-level views
- Established thresholds that triggered specific intervention playbooks
- Created executive summary for leadership review
- Trained team on interpretation and response protocols

**Result:**
At-risk accounts identified 1-2 weeks earlier. Team adopted proactive intervention approach. Dashboards became standard tool for project governance. Contributed to maintaining 92% on-time delivery.

### Likely Follow-up Questions

1. "What metrics did you include in the health score?"
2. "How did you handle data quality issues across systems?"
3. "How did you get the team to actually use the dashboards?"
4. "What interventions did you trigger based on health signals?"

### Potential Challenges/Objections

| Concern                                                     | Response                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "How do you know it was 1-2 weeks earlier?"                 | Compared timing of risk identification in dashboard vs. when issues would have surfaced through escalation in pre-dashboard period.            |
| "Power BI dashboards are common—what made yours effective?" | Integration across systems, clear thresholds tied to intervention playbooks, and embedding into team workflows rather than standalone reports. |

## Reflection

**What went well:**

- Cross-system integration provided comprehensive view
- Thresholds tied to playbooks drove action
- Leadership visibility improved governance

**What you'd do differently:**

- More automated alerting (vs. dashboard checking)
- Better mobile access for on-the-go monitoring

**Unexpected lessons:**

- Dashboard adoption requires workflow integration, not just access
- Health metrics need regular recalibration as business changes
