# Conversion Intake Optimization

## One-Liner

> Created data conversion intake playbook with standardized checklist and early sample extracts, improving sign-off time from 24 to 15 business days (37% faster) while maintaining defect rate ≤0.7 per 1,000 records.

---

## Full Context

### The Situation

Data conversion was a consistent bottleneck in implementations. Sign-off took an average of 24 business days due to unclear requirements, late discovery of mapping issues, and multiple validation cycles. Delays in data conversion cascaded into go-live delays.

### Your Role

Identified root causes of conversion delays, designed improved intake process, created standardized playbook, and implemented across projects to validate impact.

### The Approach

- Analyzed 20+ conversion cycles to identify common delay patterns
- Root causes: unclear ownership, incomplete mapping requirements, late sample data
- Designed new intake process with:
  - Standard checklist defining owners, mappings, test cycles upfront
  - Early sample extract requirement (week 2 vs. week 6)
  - Mapping workshops with customer data SMEs
  - Validation checkpoints before full conversion
- Created Conversion Intake Playbook documenting process
- Piloted on 5 projects, refined, then rolled out broadly

### The Outcome

Sign-off time improved from 24 to 15 business days (37% reduction). Maintained quality: post-go-live defects ≤0.7 per 1,000 migrated records. Interface rejects <0.4% after tuning. Playbook adopted on 87% of subsequent projects.

## Interview Preparation

### STAR Format

**Situation:**
Data conversion was taking 24 business days on average—a consistent bottleneck delaying go-lives. Issues were discovered late in the cycle, requiring multiple validation rounds.

**Task:**
Identify root causes and design an improved process that would reduce timeline without sacrificing data quality.

**Action:**

- Analyzed 20+ conversion cycles to identify delay patterns
- Found three root causes: unclear ownership, late sample data, ad-hoc mapping
- Designed new intake process with upfront checklist, early samples (week 2), and mapping workshops
- Created playbook documenting the process
- Piloted on 5 projects, measured results, refined approach
- Rolled out broadly with training for conversion team

**Result:**
Sign-off time reduced from 24 to 15 business days (37% improvement). Quality maintained at ≤0.7 defects per 1,000 records. Playbook adopted on 87% of subsequent projects.

### Likely Follow-up Questions

1. "How did you identify the root causes?"
2. "What resistance did you face from the conversion team?"
3. "How did you ensure quality didn't suffer with the faster timeline?"
4. "What was the business impact of saving 9 days?"

### Potential Challenges/Objections

| Concern                                       | Response                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "37% seems significant for a process change"  | The improvement came from eliminating waste (late discovery, rework cycles), not working faster. Early samples caught issues at week 2 instead of week 8. |
| "How do you maintain <0.7/1,000 defect rate?" | Checkpoint-based validation catches issues before full conversion. Quality is built in, not inspected at the end.                                         |

## Reflection

**What went well:**

- Data-driven root cause analysis built credibility
- Pilot approach reduced risk and built evidence
- Cross-functional involvement ensured buy-in

**What you'd do differently:**

- Earlier involvement of customer-side data SMEs in design
- More automated tracking of cycle time metrics

**Unexpected lessons:**

- Most delays were from waiting, not working
- Early samples are worth the upfront investment every time
