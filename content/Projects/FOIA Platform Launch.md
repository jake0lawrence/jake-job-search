# FOIA Platform Launch

## One-Liner

> Launched village-wide FOIA platform centralizing public records requests, saving 20 staff hours/week and improving response time and cross-department visibility.

---

## Full Context

### The Situation
FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests were handled manually—paper forms, email chains, and spreadsheet tracking. Requests often got lost between departments. Response times were inconsistent. Staff spent excessive time on administrative tracking rather than fulfilling requests.

### Your Role
Identified opportunity, evaluated solutions, led implementation, created workflows, trained staff, and measured impact.

### The Approach
- Assessed current state: volume, response times, pain points
- Evaluated platform options for municipal FOIA management
- Selected and configured platform for Village needs
- Designed intake workflow: request submission → routing → fulfillment → response
- Built cross-department visibility: status tracking, handoff protocols
- Created training materials and trained staff across departments
- Established metrics and reporting

### The Outcome
Centralized all FOIA requests into single system. Saved 20 staff hours/week on administrative tracking. Improved response time consistency. Created visibility across departments for multi-department requests.

## Interview Preparation

### STAR Format

**Situation:**
FOIA requests were handled through paper forms, email, and spreadsheets. Requests got lost between departments. Staff spent excessive time on tracking rather than fulfilling. Response times were inconsistent.

**Task:**
Implement a centralized FOIA management system that would improve efficiency, visibility, and response times.

**Action:**
- Assessed current state and documented pain points
- Evaluated platform options and selected solution
- Configured platform for Village workflows
- Designed intake-to-response process
- Created cross-department visibility and handoff protocols
- Trained staff across all departments
- Established metrics and reporting

**Result:**
Saved 20 staff hours/week. Improved response time consistency. Created cross-department visibility. Better citizen service with transparent tracking.

### Likely Follow-up Questions
1. "How did you get buy-in across departments?"
2. "What challenges did you face with adoption?"
3. "How did you measure the 20 hours/week savings?"
4. "What made this project successful?"

### Potential Challenges/Objections
| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "20 hours seems significant" | Distributed across departments. FOIA requests touch multiple people—tracking, routing, handoffs. Centralization eliminated duplicate work. |
| "Government adoption is slow" | True. Built coalition with department heads, demonstrated quick wins, involved staff in design. |
