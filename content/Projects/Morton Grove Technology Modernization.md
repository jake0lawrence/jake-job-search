## Interview Preparation

### STAR Format

**Situation:**
Village of Morton Grove was running on outdated systems—paper workflows, siloed data, manual processes. Staff productivity was constrained. Budget was limited. Leadership wanted modernization but needed clear ROI.

**Task:**
Identify highest-impact modernization opportunities, lead implementations, drive adoption, and demonstrate measurable value.

**Action:**

- Assessed operations across departments; prioritized based on impact and feasibility
- Led CentralSquare EAM rollout for Public Works—configured system, established PM schedules, trained 40+ staff
- Client-side PM for Tyler Municipal Justice implementation (Administrative Hearings)
- Launched FOIA platform reducing records request handling by 20 hours/week
- Built Power Automate workflows for cross-departmental processes
- Created training materials and led change management
- Tracked and documented value delivered

**Result:**
$200K annual value documented. EAM reduced work order backlog 20% and improved PM compliance to 85%. FOIA platform saved 20 staff hours/week. Strong adoption across departments. Demonstrated technology's value to municipal leadership.

### Likely Follow-up Questions

1. "How did you calculate the $200K value?"
2. "What resistance did you encounter and how did you handle it?"
3. "How did you prioritize which systems to implement first?"
4. "How did this experience influence your vendor-side work?"

### Potential Challenges/Objections

| Concern                                                       | Response                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Municipal government moves slowly—how did you drive change?" | Built coalition with department heads, demonstrated quick wins, engaged elected officials through regular updates. |
| "$200K seems significant for one analyst"                     | Aggregated across multiple initiatives over 2 years; documented savings through time studies and process analysis. |
