A personal job search hub designed to make it easy for friends, family, and my network to help me find my next role.

## What Is This?

This is my transparent, organized job search. Instead of sending scattered texts and emails, I built a central place where you can:

- See exactly what roles I'm looking for
- Browse my target companies
- View my resume variants
- Track where I've applied
- Find specific ways you can help

## What I'm Looking For

**Roles:** Customer Success, Implementation, or Enablement at B2B software companies

**Location:** Chicago area or remote

**Salary Target:** $100-140K base

**Sweet Spot:** GovTech companies (I have 100+ government software implementations under my belt)
